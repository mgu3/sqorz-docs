There are 3 options for member database administration:

- Externally Managed
- Self Managed
- Subscribe

## 1. Externally Managed

- The member database is managed outside Sqorz i.e. by a national organisation / federation
- Member data is imported via spreadsheet or API
- Any data imports overwrite existing data
- Adding/changing a member in an event affects that event only
- Any changes to the member database are handled outside Sqorz

## 2. Self Managed

- The member database is managed within Sqorz by the local organisation / club
- Adding/changing a member in an event updates the member database
- Any data imports append existing data

## 3. Subscribe

- The member database is managed outside Sqorz i.e. by a national organisation / federation
- Member data is imported into a Sqorz Database Account via spreadsheet or API
- Other Sqorz accounts obtain the member database from the Sqorz Database Account in real time
