## Preamble

From a technology perspective scoring with transponders can be tricky. The scoring software has 
limited information upon which to operate. In fact the only information received from the track 
is a transponder number along with a time and a gate drop along with a time. 
It is important therefore that information provided to the scoring software and team is timely and accurate.

## Successful scoring 
Successful scoring with transponders relies on a number of key items to be in place. 
Get these right and the event will be a success.

### Before the race 

- The timing system must be checked before every event â€” see how to check the timing system here LINK
- Every rider must have a working transponder
- All transponders must be correctly registered to the rider in the event

!!!NOTE 
    A checking station is a great tool to manage transponders before an event

### During the race

- Effective race and track management is in place
- All timing loops are protected from unintended stray transponder readings
- There are no riders/transponders on the track who should not be on the track(this includes riders who finish a race then ride back on the track to check on a fallen comrade for example)
- Staging must always ensure the correct riders are on the gate
- All DNF and DNS must be provided to the scoring team in a timely fashion
- Good communication with the scoring team is essential
