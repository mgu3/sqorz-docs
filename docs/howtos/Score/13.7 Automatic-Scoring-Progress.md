##Automatic Scoring Progress

We now offer two modes to control scoring progress for transponder Automatic Scoring.

- Block Scoring (recommended): this our original method that requires that scoring in one schedule block must be 
    completed before scoring can progress to the next block. This mode is recommended for most racing. 
    This method is less flexible but prevents unintended scoring, in later blocks, due to transponder accidents.
- Continuous Scoring: a new scoring mode where scoring progresses continuously, 
    without a break between schedule blocks, and without requiring the prior blocks to be complete. 
    This method is more flexible but precautions must be be taken to avoid transponder accidents.
