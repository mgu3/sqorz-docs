Gate types below.

I call them the Progate box and Version 3P (P for ProGate) as opposed to the Version 3 that
NSW mainly has which is the single SmartStart version.

**Progate**: This is what these boxes are designed for so work well.

**SmartStart**: The Version 3P work but you need to use both boxes.  The Progate box is at the SmartStart and I supply a short cable to connect from the box to the SmartStart.  Just does not look as clean as the single Version 3 box.

**Bensink**: The Version 3P is used but only the box at the decoder is required as the Bensink has an output to connect to.

**BMXtronic**: There are two versions of the BMXtronic.  Both will work with the Version 3P and ProGate boxes.  The same short cable at the SmartStart connects to the light connector on the BMXtronic.

**ProStart**: They use a Version 3P at the decoder and a box supplied by ProStart at the ProStart end. .

Then there is the dual start hill tracks.

**Dual ProGate**: need one Dual box plus two ProGate boxes.

**Dual Bensink**: only need the Dual box.
